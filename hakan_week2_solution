### Question 1: Student Grades Processing
"""You need to write a Python program to process student grades. The program should perform the following functions:

Store the information and grades of 10 students using a dictionary. Each student should have a name, surname, and grades (Midterm, Final, and Oral).

1-Calculate the average grade for each student and add it to the dictionary.

2-Find the student with the highest average grade and print it to the screen.

3-Separate the first name of each student from their surname and store them in a tuple, then add these tuples to a list.

4-Sort the list alphabetically by names and print the sorted list to the screen.

5-Store the students with an average grade below 70 in a set.

### Question 2: Movie Library Management System Project
"""
Project Description: This project aims to create an application that assists users in managing their own film collection. Users can add, edit, delete films, and view their collections.

Used Data Structures: Dictionaries (to store films and related information), Lists (to display the film collection).

Core Functions:

Create film data by obtaining information such as the film title, director, release year, and genre from the user, and store this data in a dictionary.

Provide the user with the option to edit or delete a film. (For this, functions need to be written to modify the relevant data of the film.)

Allow the user to view their collection. List all films or filter based on criteria such as genre or release year.

Store film data in a file and reload this data when the program is started.

### Question 3: Customer Management System
"""
Project Description: This project involves creating a customer management system that allows you to manage your customers and perform basic operations. The system will have fundamental functionalities such as storing customer information, adding new customers, updating customer information, deleting customers, and displaying the list of customers. Here are the basic steps for the project:

Use a dictionary structure to store customer information. Assign a unique customer identifier (ID) to each customer and associate customer information with this ID. You can use a dictionary for each customer, including information such as first name, last name, email, and phone.

Provide the user with a menu where they can choose the following operations:

* Add a new customer
* Update customer information
* Delete a customer
* Display all customers
* Exit the system
Based on the user's selection, perform the corresponding operation. For example, when adding a new customer, prompt the user for the required information and add a new customer to the dictionary.

When updating customer information, display the current information using the customer ID and save the updated information.

For the customer deletion process, take the customer ID from the user and remove that customer from the dictionary.

In the operation to display all customers, show the list of existing customers.

Repeat the operations until the user chooses to exit.
